# 🌟 ft_putstr

## 📌 Assignment Overview
**Filename:** `ft_putstr.c`  
**Allowed Functions:** `write`

Your task is to create a function that prints a given string to the standard output. This function will iterate through the string character by character and use the `write` function to display it.

## 📜 Function Prototype
```c
void ft_putstr(char *str);
```

## ⚙️ Implementation Details
- The function takes a single argument: a pointer to a character string.
- It loops through the string and prints each character one by one using `write`.
- The loop continues until the null terminator (`\0`) is encountered.

## ✨ Example Usage
```c
#include <unistd.h>

void ft_putstr(char *str);

int main() {
    ft_putstr("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

## 🚀 Key Takeaways
✔ Uses only the `write` function for output.  
✔ Handles strings properly by iterating until `\0`.  
✔ Simple and efficient implementation.  

## 📖 Learning Outcomes
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Gain a deeper understanding of string manipulation in C.
- Improve your familiarity with pointer arithmetic.
- Learn how to use the `write` function effectively.

💡 **Tip:** Always test your function with different string inputs, including empty strings and long strings!

🎯 Happy coding! 🚀
